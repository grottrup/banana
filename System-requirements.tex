\section*{Preface} \index[Alphabetical]{Preface}
The requirements rapport document include some documentation that describe our mail clients behavior and some of its features. Such documentation consists of data flow models and a system architecture or a definition of functional and nonfunctional requirements. This specific requirements rapport may not contain every detail or capture every element of our mail clients behavior and feature, because the client is in early stages of development, and the customers needs may change during the process of creating the mail client. It is expected that the requirements will change in the future, presumably with more in-depth description and with additional functionalities. \\


\section*{Introduction} \index[Alphabetical]{Introduction}
The purpose of our email client is to provide a secure service that allows the customer to communicate to others through emails. The email client will have various functions some being the essentials such as displaying, sending and deleting mails. Other functions could be the likes of blacklisting emails or attaching files/pictures to the mail. The email client will work together with a server that fetched and send emails to other recipients.

    \item \textbf{Database:}\index[Alphabetical]{Database} A Database is an organized collection of information/data, that is stored electronically in a computer system.
    \item \textbf{Agile process:}\index[Alphabetical]{Agile process} The Agile process is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with the customer and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through a process of planning, executing, and evaluating.
    \item \textbf{Plan-driven development process:}\index[Alphabetical]{Plan-driven development process} The Plan-driven development process attempts to plan and anticipate all the features the customer might want in the product and the way to build these features, before creating any software.  
    \item \textbf{System architecture:}\index[Alphabetical]{System architecture} The System architecture gives us a visual representation of the concepts behind the structure and behavior of the system, and it shows the relationship and interaction between the features of the system.
    \item \textbf{System model}:\index[Alphabetical]{System model} The Systems Model is a abstract model of the system, representing the system using graphical notation, typically UML(Unified Modeling Language).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Attach files/pictures:}\index[Functions]{Attach files/pictures} When sending an email the customer should have the ability to attach a given file or picture alongside the email. It should be noted that the file and picture cannot exceed a fixed size. 
    \item \textbf{Blacklist:}\index[Functions]{Blacklist} The customer should have the ability to register any mail in the blacklist, which function is to separate any emails, which email address has been blacklisted, into another folder. The customer should also have the ability to remove any email address from the blacklist, which will allow future emails from the address back into the main inbox.
    \item \textbf{Compose:}\index[Functions]{Compose} The customer should be able to compose an email, and be allowed to send the mail to a given email address.
    \item \textbf{Delete:}\index[Functions]{Delete} The customer can delete any email, and the deleted email will be moved to the "deleted mail" folder. Within the "deleted mail" folder, the mail will be permanently deleted after 30 days.
    \item \textbf{Display:}\index[Functions]{Display} The server client will visually display the email to the customer. 
    \item \textbf{Forward:}\index[Functions]{Forward} The customer will be able to send a copy of an email they received to a single or several email addresses. 
    \item \textbf{Login:}\index[Functions]{Login} The customer can login with own unique account.
    \item \textbf{Mark - read/unread:}\index[Functions]{Mark - read/unread} The customer will be able to mark emails as read or unread. A email that has already been read can still be marked as unread and the other way around.
    \item \textbf{Online - multiple emails:}\index[Functions]{Online - multiple emails} The customer will be able to login on multiple email accounts at the same time. 
    \item \textbf{Receive:}\index[Functions]{Receive} The customer can receive emails from emails addresses. 
    \item \textbf{Reply:}\index[Functions]{Reply} When receiving an email the customer should have the ability to reply the following email.
    \item \textbf{Send:}\index[Functions]{Send} The customer will be able to send an email to another email address, which will be send using a server.

\section*{System evolution}\index[Alphabetical]{System evolution}
The thought process behind our system has been to create a symbiosis between the plan driven development, as well as the agile process. To prepare system evolution our focus going forward is to be aware of the implementation of the the agile process, since the system will be required to change, due to  as the user needs change as well.
